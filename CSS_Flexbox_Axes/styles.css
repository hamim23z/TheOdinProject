/*
The default direction for a flex container is horizontal or a row, but we can change the direction
to vertical aka column. The syntax is simple, 

flex-direction: row;
flex-direction: column;


Flex containers have 2 axes, the main and cross. When flex direction is changed, the direction of 
these axes also change.
