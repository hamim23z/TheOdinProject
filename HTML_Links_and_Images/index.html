    <!--Links-->
    <!--To create a link in HTML, we use the anchor element. We  then use the a tag, but
    inside we need to have href inside the anchor tag. Href stands for Hypertext Reference
    and that is where we put our link-->

    <!--By default, any text without an href looks like normal text, but once we add the href
    and add a link to it, itll have a bluish tint with an underline, thus showing its a link.
    Now with this, when we click it, it does not open it in a different tag-->
    <a href="https://github.com/hamim23z">My GitHub Repository</a>

    <!--To open a link in a different tag, then we do this. We have target set to: _blank-->
    <a href="https://github.com/hamim23z" target="_blank">My GitHub Repository</a>

    <!--An optional thing to include is the rel attribite. This is used to describe the
    relation between the current page and the one in the link. It's used for security reasons
    and prevents the link to gain access to our site. But with new technology, its already done-->
    <a href="https://github.com/hamim23z" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">My GitHub Repository</a>



    <!--Absolute and Relative Links-->
    <!--The example that we above is an abolute link because it has links to pages on other websites.-->
    <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hamimc/" target="_blank">My LinkedIn</a>

    <!--A relative link is a link that includes file paths to another page that you are working on. For
    example, I have example.html in this folder, so below is an example-->
    <a href="example.html" target="_blank">Link to Example Page</a>
    


    <!--Images-->
    <!--To display an image, use the img tag. There is no ending tag for this, it is a self closing tag. 
    For the most part, when we use Images, we have then inside a folder called Images and then we simply
    add it to the source. Now the alt is used to describe an image. If for some reason the image cannot load, 
    the alt text will be shown instead-->
    <!--For images, we usually change the height and width. This is more commonly done in CSS but we can
    do it here as well. -->
    <img src="html5.png" alt="The HTML 5 Logo"  height="100" width="200">
