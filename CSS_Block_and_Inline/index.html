<!--
Different display types and unique box models and we can modify
the calculation by changing the display property. There are two
box types: block and inline. 


display: block
    Block elements will appear on the page stacked atop of each
    other and each element starts on a new line. 

display: inline-block
    Inline Block elements behave like regular inline elements
    but with block style padding and margin. BUT, flexbox is used
    more often for this. 


div is a block level element by default. And div is used as a container
element usually to group other elements. On the other hand, span is an 
inline element by default.
