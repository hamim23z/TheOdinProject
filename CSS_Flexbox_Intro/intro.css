/*
A flex container is any element that has a display: flex on it. 
A flex item is any element that lives inside of a flex container. 
Any element can be both a flex container and a flex item. We can do display:flex on any flex item and then use flexbox to arrange its children. 
-   Creating and nesting multiple flex containers and items is the primary way we will be building up complex layouts.
