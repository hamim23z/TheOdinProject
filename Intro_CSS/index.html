<!-- CSS allows us to use styles to our HTML. Theres a various amount of
rules that we can add. It's syntax is selector {property: value;}

The universal selector will select elements of any type and the syntax for
it is a simple asterik. So for example,
* {
color: red;
}


Type Selectors will select all elements of the given element type and the
syntax for that is:
div {
color: blue;
}


Class/ID Selectors will select just that certain class. We need to set a
class or id for a certain tag. In CSS, a class styling begins with . and 
and id starts with #

<div class = "main-text" id = "also-main-text"> 
    <p>Random text</p>
</div>

.main-text {
color: red;
}

#also-main-text {
color: green;
}
